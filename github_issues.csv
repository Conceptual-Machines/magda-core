"Fix Build System - gRPC Dependencies","The build system has conflicts with gRPC and protobuf dependencies. Need to:

1. Fix gRPC target naming (use `grpc++` instead of `gRPC::grpc++`)
2. Configure gRPC CMake options properly before FetchContent_MakeAvailable
3. Remove vcpkg conflicts by setting `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE = ""`
4. Fix protobuf plugin target references

**Current Error:**
```
No target "gRPC::grpc_cpp_plugin"
Target "magica_mcp" links to gRPC::grpc++ but the target was not found
```

**Solution:**
- Set gRPC CMake variables before `FetchContent_MakeAvailable(gRPC)`
- Use `grpc++` and `gpr` targets instead of `gRPC::grpc++`
- Use `$<TARGET_FILE:grpc_cpp_plugin>` for protobuf generation","build-system,grpc,cmake","High","","Build System"
