                   LINES OF CODE ANALYSIS COMPLETE
===============================================================================

Analysis Date: February 7, 2026
Scope: All C++ files > 1000 LOC (excluding AudioBridge, which is being refactored)

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
• 20 files identified exceeding 1,000 lines of code
• Total lines analyzed: 34,487 across these files
• 3 CRITICAL files (>2,500 LOC) requiring immediate attention
• 70% of large files are UI components

CRITICAL FILES (>2,500 LOC):
---------------------------
1. InspectorContent.cpp         - 3,353 lines
2. TrackManager.cpp             - 2,573 lines  
3. TrackContentPanel.cpp        - 2,540 lines

HIGH PRIORITY FILES (2,000-2,500 LOC):
--------------------------------------
4. MainWindow.cpp               - 2,400 lines
5. TrackHeadersPanel.cpp        - 2,203 lines
6. ClipComponent.cpp            - 2,007 lines

REPORTS GENERATED:
-----------------
1. LOC_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md
   • 495-line comprehensive markdown report
   • Detailed file-by-file analysis with metrics
   • Specific refactoring recommendations for each file
   • General guidelines and refactoring patterns
   • Prioritized next steps

2. loc_analysis_summary.csv
   • Quick reference data in CSV format
   • Easily importable into spreadsheets or analysis tools
   • Includes all metrics for 20 files

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
-------------------
Immediate (Critical):
  → Refactor InspectorContent.cpp into separate inspector types
  → Split TrackManager.cpp into Factory/Registry/Operations classes
  → Break down TrackContentPanel.cpp by extracting rendering/interaction/layout

Short-term (High Priority):
  → Extract menu/toolbar managers from MainWindow.cpp
  → Separate rendering from interaction in TrackHeadersPanel.cpp
  → Decompose ClipComponent.cpp into smaller focused components

Medium-term:
  → Review and plan refactoring for 4 medium-priority files (1,500-2,000 LOC)
  → Establish patterns from successful refactorings
  → Update coding guidelines

Ongoing:
  → Monitor file sizes during code reviews
  → Set LOC thresholds in coding standards
  → Consider static analysis tools (lizard, cloc, etc.)
