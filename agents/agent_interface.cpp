#include "agent_interface.hpp"

// This file contains the implementation of the AgentInterface class.
// Since AgentInterface is a pure virtual interface, there's no implementation needed here.
// This file exists to satisfy the CMakeLists.txt requirements and can be used
// for any future shared functionality across all agents.
