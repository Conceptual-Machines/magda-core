# AI Assistant

MAGDA includes a built-in AI chat assistant that lets you control the DAW using natural language.

## Overview

The AI Assistant panel is located in the right side of the window. Type a request in plain English and the assistant translates it into actions:

- "Add a MIDI track with a bass clip"
- "Transpose the selected notes up an octave"
- "Set the tempo to 120 BPM"
- "Mute tracks 3 and 4"

The assistant is **context-aware** — it knows which tracks, clips, and devices exist in your project and what is currently selected.

## How It Works

1. You type a natural-language request in the chat
2. The assistant translates your request into MAGDA's internal DSL (domain-specific language)
3. The DSL commands are executed as actions in the project
4. The assistant confirms what was done

## Setup

To enable the AI Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings > Preferences > AI**
2. Enter your API key
3. Select a model

## Usage Tips

- Be specific: "Add a reverb to Track 2" works better than "make it sound spacey"
- The assistant can handle multi-step requests: "Create 4 MIDI tracks and name them Kick, Snare, HiHat, Bass"
- Use it for repetitive tasks: "Set all tracks to -6 dB"
